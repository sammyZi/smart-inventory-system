# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Inventory & Billing Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to manage inventory across multiple locations with real-time synchronization, AI-powered forecasting, IoT integration, and blockchain-based supply chain tracking. The system serves different user roles (admin, manager, staff, customer) with appropriate access controls and provides both web and mobile interfaces for inventory management, billing, and analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure multi-factor authentication with role-based access control, so that only authorized users can access appropriate system functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Firebase Auth with email/password or biometric options
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL assign role-based permissions (admin, manager, staff, customer)
3. WHEN a user accesses a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions before granting access
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and implement rate limiting after 5 failed attempts
5. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for sensitive operations

### Requirement 2: Multi-Location Inventory Management

**User Story:** As a manager, I want real-time inventory synchronization across all store locations, so that I can maintain accurate stock levels and prevent overselling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory is updated at any location THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes to all other locations within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a product is sold THEN the system SHALL automatically update inventory levels across all locations
3. WHEN inventory falls below minimum threshold THEN the system SHALL trigger automated reorder notifications
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue changes locally and sync when connection is restored
5. WHEN inventory conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve using timestamp-based conflict resolution

### Requirement 3: Product Catalog and Tracking

**User Story:** As a staff member, I want to track products using QR codes, RFID, or NFC tags, so that I can efficiently manage inventory operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is scanned THEN the system SHALL identify the product using QR/RFID/NFC data
2. WHEN a new product is added THEN the system SHALL generate unique tracking codes and store product metadata
3. WHEN product information is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and audit trail
4. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL process multiple items efficiently with batch operations
5. WHEN invalid codes are scanned THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest corrections

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Demand Forecasting

**User Story:** As a manager, I want AI-powered demand forecasting and automated reordering, so that I can optimize inventory levels and reduce stockouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN historical sales data is available THEN the system SHALL generate demand forecasts using TensorFlow.js models
2. WHEN demand patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal reorder quantities and timing
3. WHEN seasonal trends are identified THEN the system SHALL adjust forecasting models accordingly
4. WHEN forecast accuracy drops below 80% THEN the system SHALL retrain models with recent data
5. WHEN automated reorder conditions are met THEN the system SHALL generate purchase orders for approval

### Requirement 5: IoT Sensor Integration

**User Story:** As a warehouse operator, I want IoT sensors to monitor inventory conditions and automate data collection, so that I can maintain product quality and accurate counts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weight sensors detect changes THEN the system SHALL update inventory quantities automatically
2. WHEN temperature sensors detect out-of-range conditions THEN the system SHALL alert relevant staff immediately
3. WHEN IoT devices connect THEN the system SHALL authenticate devices using secure MQTT protocols
4. WHEN sensor data is received THEN the system SHALL validate and store readings with timestamps
5. WHEN IoT devices go offline THEN the system SHALL continue operations and alert administrators

### Requirement 6: Blockchain Supply Chain Tracking

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want blockchain-based supply chain verification, so that I can ensure product authenticity and traceability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products enter the supply chain THEN the system SHALL record immutable blockchain transactions
2. WHEN supply chain events occur THEN the system SHALL update blockchain records with verified timestamps
3. WHEN authenticity verification is requested THEN the system SHALL provide blockchain-based proof of origin
4. WHEN blockchain nodes are unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue transactions and process when available
5. WHEN supply chain audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide complete traceability reports

### Requirement 7: Billing and Point of Sale

**User Story:** As a cashier, I want an efficient point-of-sale system with multiple payment options, so that I can process customer transactions quickly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are scanned at checkout THEN the system SHALL calculate totals including taxes and discounts
2. WHEN payment is processed THEN the system SHALL support multiple payment methods (cash, card, digital wallets)
3. WHEN transactions are completed THEN the system SHALL generate receipts and update inventory automatically
4. WHEN refunds are processed THEN the system SHALL reverse inventory changes and maintain audit trails
5. WHEN offline mode is active THEN the system SHALL process transactions locally and sync when online

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Analytics and Reporting

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want real-time dashboards and analytics, so that I can make informed decisions about inventory and business operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard is accessed THEN the system SHALL display real-time inventory levels across all locations
2. WHEN sales data is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh analytics dashboards within 5 seconds
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide customizable date ranges and filtering options
4. WHEN performance metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL show trends, forecasts, and KPIs
5. WHEN data export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)

### Requirement 9: Mobile Application Support

**User Story:** As a field staff member, I want a mobile application with offline capabilities, so that I can manage inventory operations even without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mobile app is used offline THEN the system SHALL cache essential data and queue operations
2. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL synchronize all offline changes automatically
3. WHEN mobile scanning is performed THEN the system SHALL support camera-based QR code scanning
4. WHEN push notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL alert users about critical inventory events
5. WHEN mobile data usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL optimize data transfer and provide usage statistics

### Requirement 10: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive security measures and audit logging, so that I can protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input and protect against injection attacks
3. WHEN user actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log all activities with user identification and timestamps
4. WHEN security incidents are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement automatic countermeasures
5. WHEN compliance audits are conducted THEN the system SHALL provide complete audit trails and security reports
