  'DATA_ACCESS',
  'products',
  { productId, action: 'READ' },
  request,
  success
)
```

```typescript
// Different rate limits for each role
ADMIN: 1000 requests/15min
MANAGER: 500 requests/15min  
STAFF: 200 requests/15min
CUSTOMER: 100 requests/15min
GUEST: 50 requests/15min
```

```typescript
// Comprehensive validation with security checks
const validation = securityService.validateInput(data, rules, userContext)
// Includes: SQL injection detection, XSS prevention, data sanitization
```

### Automated Threat Detection
```typescript
// Real-time suspicious activity monitoring
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Cross-tenant access attempts
- Unusual request patterns
- Automated bot detection
```

### Security Alert System
```typescript
// Automated security alerts with severity levels
CRITICAL: Immediate attention required
HIGH: Security incident detected
MEDIUM: Suspicious activity
LOW: Informational security event
```
